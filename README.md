WA2 Project - Fashion Searcher

When i would go shopping online, I would always find it tedious to browse through various websites. This project was inspired as a solution to that problem by compiling web results into 1 web app, thereby making it easier for me to look for things online. To extract and collate results from other website, I learned the basics of web scraping in this project, which led me to learn about APIs. Using python's Request library to interact with website APIS, I was able to successfully get data from websites, and from there i learned about the structure of JSON, and was able to make extract meaningful data from the raw JSON. Some challenges I faced was learning about how to make requests with python, to finding the correct url and request parameters I needed to include in each request. I spent a lot of my time in the Network tab in Inspect, learning about how http requests were made. For instance, I learned about query string parameters and form data, because my POST request in https://www.endclothing.com/sg used string parameters in their request while https://www.grailed.com/ handled form data. In the future, there are some improvements to my code that can be made, for example making my code more secure. In my source code, I used my local browser's settings to make requests, which is DEFINITELY not safe. Functionality wise, next time I hope to be able to add a filter to the search engine, but that will come when my skills with making requests improve.
